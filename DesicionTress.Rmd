Reading in the dataset: All come in as expected (date is a character, but we don't need this because it's not really realted to the song data)

```{r}
setwd("/Users/pavan/Desktop/Git/6101 project/DS-6101-Final")
music = data.frame(read.csv("music_genre.csv"))
```

```{r}
# drop those blank genre values 
music = music[!(music$music_genre == ""),]
```
Prepossessing the Genre Column with dummy variables

```{r, results = 'markup'}
music$music_genre <- factor(music$music_genre)
str(music)
```

```{r, results = 'markup'}
music_tree<-subset(music, music_genre == 6 | 7)
treefit <- tree(music_genre ~ liveness + loudness, data=music_tree)
plot(treefit) 
```
